## § 2 - Do not use discriminatory or derogatory language

Promotion of white supremacy, xenophobia, genocide denial, racism, sexism, disablism, fascism, neo-nazism, inceldom, or other discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is included under this rule.

This includes political opinions in meta even if all parties to the conversation are comfortable, if such messages: (1) allege a group of people are inferior for their inherent traits; (2) are directed towards or levying unfair accusations against any figure on a discriminatory basis; (3) contain any slurs or other vitriol; or (4) are used in a deliberate attempt to subvert regulations against any of the above.

Reasonable discretion should be exercised on what is clearly satirical. However, individuals should take care to avoid making jokes that have the potential to make others uncomfortable.

Targeting and harassing individuals in a discriminatory manner is impermissible under any circumstances and will result in a permanent ban. Staff are expected to exercise discretion and respond in a measured manner for milder cases where individuals can be reasonably understood to act in good faith.

**Punishment**

2 hours; 
Cont. +2 hours per total

---

## § 3 - Do not harass or discriminate against any user. This includes collecting or distributing unauthorized recordings of others’ voice or body.

Harassment includes repetitive intentional annoyance. If someone asks to stop, you should do so. Those collecting or posting recordings of others should have prior permission, implicit or explicit.

**Punishment**

2 hours for minor violations; 
Refer to § 1, Cat. 2 for major/severe violations, e.g. doxing.

---

## § 4 - Do not spam or flood the chat.

Staff will typically ask the user to stop such spam before any consequences are applied. A factor in consideration should be whether messages disrupt the flow of the chat. Messages should be sent in their appropriate channels.

#venting should be used in a respectful and responsible manner, and individuals not doing so will be removed from the channel.

Bank and other commands should not be posted in #virtual-congress-chat in a disruptive manner, but will not be penalized unless clear instructions against doing so have been issued.

Penalties for violating this rule typically extend to mute of 30 minutes, but instances of abuse may be punishable by mute of up to 72 hours. Staff will strive to avoid issuing penalties, instead making clear that actions in violation of this rule should be avoided.

**Punishment**

30 minutes; 
Cont. 1 hour per total

---

## § 5 - Do not ghost ping or mass ping

Ghost pinging is defined as deleting a ping after sending it. Mass pinging is defined as either pinging a large number of users, or repeatedly pinging users. Both variants are punishable if the individual(s) being pinged raises an issue with it.

Penalties for violating this rule typically extend to mute of 30 minutes, but instances of abuse may be punishable by mute of up to 72 hours. Staff will strive to avoid issuing penalties, instead making clear that actions in violation of this rule should be avoided.

**Punishment**

For smaller roles, 1 hour; 
For larger roles, 24 hours; 
Cont. +1/+24 hour(s) per total

## § 6 - Do not commit or participate in election fraud

Election fraud includes, but is not limited to:

- Inviting users to the server with the primary intent of recruiting voters;
- Fraud pertaining to member-wide polls on the operations of the server; and
- Non-roleplay intentional spread of false information to influence the result of an election.

Severities are, with examples:

- **Minor**
    - Importing a single friend to vote without campaigning openly
    - Misrepresentation of candidate policy in a potentially malicious way
    - Using ambiguous wording to sway/rig a vote

    - Recruiting multiple voters privately with the purpose of influencing the vote
    - Attempting to suppress turnout via misinformation (e.g. "the vote is cancelled")
    - Disguising endorsements as "official FEC guidance" without authorization

    - Using alt(s) to cast fraudulent votes or participate in elections in any capacity (see § 15 as well)
    - Leaking/publishing internal FEC discussions and documents without authorization
    - Repeated election fraud despite prior bans or penalties

The Federal Election Commission has the authority to take corrective action, including voter and candidate disqualification, roleplay-based negative modifiers and voiding of an election. The Federal Election Commission may issue recommendations for further penalties up to and including a permanent ban.

**Punishment**

Minor; Ban from participating in elections for 8 months; Cont. temp ban for the remainder of the RP ban, but no less than 4 months.

## § 7 - Do not hack the server or its users

Don’t raid the server. Don't send or link harmful or malicious software and systems which may result in undue damage to others, including viruses and IP grabbers.

It is strictly against the rules to gain access to someone else’s account without express permission. At the same time, individuals are expected to take reasonable actions to secure and protect their Discord account from malicious users.

Penalties for violating this rule extend up to and including a permanent ban.

It is impermissible to obtain or exploit unauthorized access to channels or other Discord permissions, but staff should exercise discretion when addressing these violations particularly in cases resulting from staff error or without malice.

It is strictly against the rules to retain permissions to an asset of Virtual Congress without the authority to do so, and penalties may extend up to and including a permanent ban.

**Punishment**

Indefinite ban

---

## § 8 - Do not penalty evade or use multiple accounts simultaneously on the server

Penalty evading is a deliberate attempt to avoid a penalty, such as a mute or ban, by leaving and rejoining the server. Cases where an individual rejoins after their penalty has lapsed do not constitute penalty evasion.

Individuals not subject to ongoing penalties may leave the server and rejoin on a new account at a later date. However, individuals with ongoing negative modifiers must self-report details regarding their previous and current accounts to the Federal Election Commission.

Deliberate violations of this rule will result in a permanent ban under any circumstances. Staff may exercise discretion and allow individuals violating this rule out of genuine ignorance to only be subject to their previous penalties.

**Punishment**

6 month temp ban for first offense; 
Permanent ban for second attempt

---

## § 9 - Do not lie to staff

This exclusively applies to matters relating to moderation on the server. Reporting of rule violations should be in good faith, without deliberately using alleged violations to blackmail or otherwise threaten others.

Penalties for violating this rule extend up to and including a permanent ban.

**Punishment**

30 minutes for minor violations; Cont. +1 hour per total
4 hours for major violations; Cont. +4 hours per total
Indefinite ban for severe violations

---

## § 10 - Do not misrepresent yourself or others within the server.

Changing one's profile picture or name in purposeful imitation of other users is not allowed. This excludes cases where the user in question has provided explicit or implicit permission, and where the change is clearly satirical in nature for a reasonable period.

Staff will advise individuals violating this rule not to do so, but may indefinitely mute individuals until they are in compliance with this rule.

Deliberately spreading false information about others' actions or characteristics, whether in-server or elsewhere, is also subject to this rule. Such misinformation, when intended to harm someone's reputation or relationships within the community, will be treated as a violation of this rule.

**Punishment**

Canada until profile/violation is changed;
2 month temp ban for severe violations

---

## § 11 - Do not use information in roleplay that is gained outside of roleplay means.

Your character may not use information that they would not otherwise canonically have had access to, including communication in non-roleplay channels (including non-roleplay-related direct messages and non-roleplay-related voice calls).

Your character may not take actions that they would not otherwise have reasonably taken as a result of the information that they had in roleplay, including non-roleplay grievances.
Players may not leak information about roleplay in non-roleplay channels, unless reporting a rules violation. All individuals are to refrain from harassing others in response to actions within roleplay.
Under no circumstances are staff permitted to use non-public information to advantage their character in roleplay.

Avoid sending non-roleplay messages in roleplay channels to the greatest reasonable extent. When such non-roleplay messages must be sent, they should be clearly labeled so.
Roleplay disputes should be resolved in roleplay to the greatest reasonable extent. Individuals may not gather information or coordinate in non-roleplay channels for roleplay purposes.

**Punishment**

48 hours; Cont. +24 hours per total
Information retcon

---

## § 12 - Do not manipulate your character to gain an unfair advantage in roleplay.

Simply making a claim does not make such a claim true. Individuals may not perform actions with their characters that their respective characters would not have been capable of performing.
Individuals may not control any characters other than their own, unless otherwise authorized.

Instances will be retconned at the discretion of administrators and moderators.

**Punishment**

Retcon and warning; Cont. +4 hours per total 

---

## § 13 - Do not be a troll or be toxic.

Self-explanatory. Penalties may vary from mutes to bans, depending on severity, repetition, credible commitments to refrain in future and contribution to server. Administrators and moderators will take into account the circumstances that individuals may be genuinely or perceive themselves to be in.

For clarity, the following are examples of each severity level of trolling/toxicity:

- **Minor violations:** Light banter that crosses a line, mild antagonistic behavior, or occasional disruptive comments that don't seriously impact server atmosphere.
- **Major violations:** Repeated antagonistic behavior, intentional disruption of server activities, sustained negative attitude affecting multiple users, or coordinated attempts to create drama.
- **Severe violations:** Organized trolling campaigns, extreme toxicity causing significant server disruption, malicious behavior intended to harm the community, or repeated major violations after multiple warnings.

Staff should consider context, intent, and pattern of behavior when determining severity levels. A single incident may be elevated to a higher severity if it shows clear malicious intent or causes substantial harm to the community.

A mutually-toxic discussion between members of staff of similar rank, or members of the community, in which escalation and participation in the discussion are similar between the participating parties shall not be subject to a greater punishment than a 30-minute mute under this rule.

**Punishment**

2 hours for minor violations; Cont. +2 hours
12 hours for major violations; Cont. +12 hours
76 hours for severe violations; Cont. refer to § 1 and ban indefinitely or permanently

---

## § 14 - No Server Advertising

Promoting other Discord servers without Admin approval is strictly prohibited, either in the server or to server members in DMs, and will result in a punishment up to, and including, a ban. Server partnerships are allowed with permission from the Partnership Team.

**Punishment**

2 hours for unauthorized or accidental advertising from a server member; Cont. +2 hours
New person joining the server for the sole purpose of advertising is a permanent ban

## § 15 – Do not use alternate accounts to gain an advantage or avoid accountability

The use of alternate accounts ("alts") is strictly regulated to maintain fairness and transparency. No user may have an alt within the server or it’s affiliated servers for any reason, benevolent or malicious, unless they have explicit permission to do so either by the Admins or the Federal Election Commission in relation to elections and the election system. Aliases are not considered alts, and may be used freely by staff and the different teams, while still personally responsible to the rules.

**Punishment**

Indefinite ban for non-malicious use or intent
Permanent ban for malicious use or intent
